## Problem Set 1: C

#### Hello
This is a simple "Hello, world!" print.

#### Mario (less & more)
I created one (for less comfortable) and two (for more comfortable) pyramids in C with hashes (#) for bricks, using for loop.

#### Cash (less comfortable)
I created a program in C to calculate the coins due for cashiers while minimize the number of coins by applying a simple greedy algorithms.

#### Credit (more comfortable)
I implemented a program in C to detect credit card's typos (e.g., transpositions), if not fraudulent numbers by applying Luhn’s Algorithm. 


## Problem Set 2: Arrays

#### Readability
I implemented a program in C that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend a given text by using the Coleman-Liau index. 

#### Caesar (less comfortable)
I implemented a program in C that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher.

#### Substitution (more comfortable)
I implemented a program in C that implements a substitution cipher.

## Problem Set 3: Algorithms

#### Plurality
I implemented a program in C that runs a plurality election.

#### Runoff (less comfortable)
I implemented a program in C that runs a runoff election.

#### Tideman (more comfortable)
I implemented a program in C that runs a Tideman election, using BubbleSort, MergeSort, InsertionSort and recursion.


## Problem Set 4: Memory

#### Filter (more & less)
I implemented a program in C that applies filters (grayscale, sepia, reflection, blur and edge) to BMPs.

#### Recover 
I implemented a program in C that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image.



## Problem Set 5: Data structures

#### Speller
I implemented a program in C that spell-checks a file using a hash table.


## Problem Set 6: Python

#### C sentimentals
I recreated 6 programs (Hello, Mario less & more, Cash, Credit, Readability) in Python

#### DNA
I implemented a Python program that identifies a person based on their DNA, using regular expression.


## Problem Set 7: SQL

#### Movies
I wrote 13 SQL queries to answer questions about a database of movies.

#### Houses
I implemented a Python program to import Hogwarts student data into a SQLite database, and then produce class rosters.


## Problem Set 8: Information

#### Homepage
I created a simple homepage using HTTP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### Finance
I created a simulated web application via which users can “buy” and “sell” stocks, using Python Flask, SQLite, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


## Final project

#### Self-love Tracker
I created a simple web application in which users could keep track of their possitive affirmations.
