 This Final Project is completed as a part of CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science, Harvard University. It's a web application named *“Self-love Tracker”*
</p>

## About this course
This is CS50x , Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


With a combination of Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQLite database, this web application is a place to store your daily possitive affirmations.
You could write as many affirmations each day, but remember to add tags for easier retrieve.
To read your affirmations, you could search by date, by tags or by exact words in text. Or if you have time, you could read all the affirmations.
The latest affirmations would be displayed on top.
The main page gives you an overview of the affirmations calendar (inspired by GitHub contributions graph) and a wordcloud made from your most frequently used words in the current year.
