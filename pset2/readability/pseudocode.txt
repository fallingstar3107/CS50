// INCLUDE THE NEEDED LIBRARIES

// INITIALISE THE SUB FUNCTIONS BEFORE THE MAIN FUNCTION
initialise the 1st sub function to prompt the string (input)
initialise the 2nd sub function to count the number of letters
initialise the 3rd sub function to count the number of words
initialise the 4th sub function to count the number of sentences
initialise the 5th sub function to calculate the grade

MAIN FUNCTION
    // GET STRING
    call the 1st sub function to get the string

    // COUNT THE NO. OF LETTER, WORD AND SENTENCE TO CALCULATE THE INDEX NUMBER
    call other sub functions to pass the index

    // PRINT THE GRADE
    If a grade is equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level
        Print "Grade 16+"
    Else if a grade is less than 1
        Print "Before Grade 1"
    Else
        Print the actual grade

GETSTRING FUNCTION
    Prompt the string (input)
        While getting a null input, prompt again
    return the result

COUNTLETTER FUNCTION
    For loop: set the no. of iteration equal to the no. of char in string
        if the char is a alphabetic letter
            increment the letter total count by 1
    return the result

COUNTWORD FUNCTION
    For loop: set the no. of iteration equal to the no. of char in string
        if the char is a blank space
            increment the word total count by 1
    increment the word total count by 1, as the total no. of blank space + 1 = the total no. of word
    return the result

COUNTSENTENCE FUNCTION
    For loop: set the no. of iteration equal to the no. of char in string
        if encounter a puntuation in  {".", "!", "?"}
            increment the sentence total count by 1
    return the result

CALCULATE-GRADE FUNCTION
    calculate L (no. of letter / no. of word * 100)
    calculate S (no. of sentence / no. of word * 100)
    calculate index (0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8)
    return index
