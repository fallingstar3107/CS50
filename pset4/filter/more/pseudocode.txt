Detect edges
    declare a new bitmap to store the blur pixels
    declare 3x3 Gx and Gy matrixes to generate the edges images

    loop all rows of pixels
        loop all pixels in a row
            initialise the new values Gx_red, Gx_green, Gx_blue of each pixel
            initialise the new values Gy_red, Gy_green, Gy_blue of each pixel
            calculate the Gx_red, Gy_red, ... of surrounding pixels
            loop 3 rows of pixels
                loop 3 pixels in a row
                    allocate 3 BYTE size of memory for 3 color value in each pixel
                    if the current pixel is not existed
                        set the color value to 0
                    else if the current pixel is existed
                        put the color value into the memory assigned
                    add the current pixel, after multiplying by the Gx (Gy) parameter to the Gx, Gy sum
                    free the dynamic memory allocated
            Set *edge_red (*edge_green/*edge_blue) is the Red (Green/Blue) value in each pixel
            set the edge value to the rounded average color value of adjacent pixel and the current one

    loop all rows of pixels
        loop all pixels in a row
            copy the value from the edge image to the current image
