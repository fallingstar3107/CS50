Make sure that the user give only 1 command argument

Open input file
If input file cannot be read, exit the program

Keep track of how many JPEGs read by initialise the counter count_jpeg

Allocate 8 bytes for outfile name
If there's not enough available memory, exit the program

Declare the outfile (to keep opening it to write several blocks)

Allocate 512 bytes for each block to read

while the total bytes read is still 512 (no null bytes)
    Check first four bytes in a 512-bytes block
    if it's JPEG first 4 bytes pattern
        set the new outfile name

        If it's the first image
            open outfile
            write to outfile
        Otherwise,
            close the last outfile
            open new outfile
            write to outfile
        increment the number of images read by 1
    else
        if the 1st image has been found, and the current block is not the 1st block of an image
            continue to write into the opening outfile
        if the 1st image has not been found, and the current block is not the 1st block of an image, do nothing

Close infile and outfile
